# coordinates start at 0 and begin from the upper left corner
# the first coordinate is on x (horizontal) axis and the second one is on y (vertical) axis
# two pairs of coordinates before vertical line | are those of endpoints
# the rest of the coordinates are those of every walkable tile on the grid, i.e. '+', '-' and '|'
